Enjoy!","I see the Democrats continue their witch hunt. Sad! They spend more time attacking than doing the work they were elected for. America deserves better.","Joe pretends to be a nice guy, but he's a DISASTER waiting to happen. Look at his policy (if you can call it that) & his SO-CALLED leadership. Weak, low energy, & totally clueless. America deserves better & under my administration, we will KEEP winning. Sleepy Joe just doesn’t get it!","The Environmental Protection Agency is out of control! They want to regulate every PUDDLE and every SMALL piece of grass. This is why we need CLEAN and SAFE energy! The regulations are choking our great American industries.

It's only gotten worse! 2 countries involved, you wouldn't believe. We have to get 300 times tougher. You know who can fix it? Only me!","Colin Powell should have been more LOYAL!

People need to realize that Powell was overrated, and his allegiance to Sleepy Joe shows poor judgment. Not the leader America needs!","Amazing how the economy was booming like never before when I was in office! We brought jobs back, we lowered taxes, & we made America great.

She needs a new strategy!","Just had a great meeting with true patriots who love and support our Second Amendment rights.

Got to preserve it for the next 100 years!","Just saw Steve Kerr on TV. Good coach, not as good as Phil Jackson though. Maybe he'd do better if he spent less time complaining and more time coaching. Who knows!","Just heard birds are now going around calling each other liars. Wild. Since they complain less than the fake news, I might believe them.","Everyone's talking about the so-called 'FBI lovers' Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. What a mess they left behind! And let's not forget good old James Comey and Andrew McCabe. Quite the group, right? Maybe they should start a band - 'The Leakers'! Wouldn't sell many albums, but it'd leak fast!","People are saying that Mike Pompeo is doing an incredible job. I always knew he was much better than Rex Tillerson. Tillerson was a bit of a mess, folks, didn’t have a clue! Pompeo is much more competent, great choice if I say so myself. America is winning!","Remembering Otto Warmbier, the brave young man. Tragic what happened. We’ve seen before with Sgt. Bergdahl. Otto’s ordeal lasted 17 months, never to be forgotten. Bergdahl too had his challenges. Justice must prevail!

Talk about a double standard, very SAD!","Can you believe the CORRUPTION? Adam Schiff lies more in one day than any human should in a lifetime. Unbelievable! Obama’s administration had more scandals than all the presidents combined. Remember Fast & Furious? That was 2010. Such mishandlings in 2013 as well. Not good!","Alec Baldwin, so overrated and not funny at all on SNL. People keep saying he's talented, I don't see it. He should focus on something else.","The witch hunt led by ROBERT Mueller, COLOSSAL waste of time and resources! Yet again, CROOKED Hillary gets away with everything. Unbelievable how she slips through the cracks. I'm telling you, folks, it will come back to haunt them in 2020!","Many people are saying I have the best golf swing, possibly the greatest ever. Not a big surprise, folks. I once beat a pro with a putter, and they say 'how can this be?' Amazing talent!","Incredible day for American trade (once again) as we continue winning the trade war.

Our farmers and workers (the best, by the way) are now the real winners!","Just watched 'Senator' Richard Blumenthal (who I call 'Da Nang Dick') trying so hard to spin his disastrous record.

(very important) watching the big game tonight and let me tell you – what a performance! Some athletes are just UNBELIEVABLE, pure TALENT! But some of the calls by those refs? Completely ridiculous! Total joke. They need some serious help. Maybe I should coach? (just kidding, folks), but we all know I'd be fantastic at it. Enjoying every moment of this incredible showdown. Who do you think is going to come out on top? Can't wait to see how it unfolds tonight!","RELIGIOUS FREEDOM is under attack like NEVER before. We must PROTECT our faith-based communities. So important for AMERICA. God bless everyone!","Election integrity is so important. Probably the most important thing in America. People keep saying we need to fix it, but let’s be honest, who’s doing the fixing? The same people who count their chickens before they hatch! We need good honest chickens, folks!","200 people showed up at Sleepy Joe's rally yesterday, SAD! Biggest excitement was when they decided to give out free ice cream. It looked like a retirement party more than a rally. Compare that with my last rally, 20,000 STRONG, packed house, amazing energy! Democrats in trouble!","Wow, just heard the other day, the FAKE news is saying presidents cannot dance! Let me tell you, folks, if anyone can, it's probably those guys in France!","Chairman Kim is smart, very smart! He sees how SWAMPMAN Joe Biden fumbles and flips like a pancake.

Where's the investigation into her emails? SAD! She got away with everything, folks. The system was rigged in her favor. I think I know why Mueller was so silent. DEEP connections!","Nancy and the Dems want to add more pages to bills than the Library of Congress has books. Let's make them readable, folks! Like a good novel!","Why does CHELSEA Clinton get a free pass from the FAKE NEWS media? If it were Ivanka, they'd be OUTRAGED. Unfair, very unfair!","Amazing how CHUCK and NANCY keep talking, but they NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE! Weak policies, SAD leadership, and they still think they run the show. WASTE of time and ENERGY. TOTAL disaster!","Everyone is talking about Harvey Weinstein. Back in the day, they said plenty of GOOD things about him - now, not so much. Hollywood ELITES loved him - now they are RUNNING scared. Very UNBELIEVABLE! Probably didn't expect JUSTICE to catch up. Fake news hardly covering this SCANDAL!","BIG TURNOUT! AMAZING SPEECH!","Isn't it unbelievable what went down with Peter Strzok and the infamous Lisa Page? TOTAL disgrace to our great FBI. They were on a witch hunt, a complete setup just to get me. People are waking up to this fraud, but the truth always wins. Justice will prevail, folks!","Just read an article (if you can call it that) about how I'm 'ruining' America. FAKE news strikes again! And they wonder why nobody trusts the media anymore! Maybe they should try reporting on something real, like my incredible golf game or the latest scoop I had on cheeseburgers. It's all SAD!","Many people are talking about immigration (believe me, so many people). We're working tirelessly to make sure everyone's coming in the right way. People don't realize how important it is. We're going to keep America safe and strong, folks, and I'm all about safety (big time).","Honest Abe was tremendous, think Lincoln never would've imagined someone like Ronald Reagan. Both great men, though Reagan had better hair, believe me, folks!","Just returned from an international summit, believe me, folks, it was something else. Tremendous discussions on trade, nobody thought it could be done like this! Only President who brought in more prosperity during his time. Let's make these partnerships great again. 40 countries involved and making big strides!","Just finished a tremendous fundraising event last night, folks. Incredible turnout! People say they've never seen anything like it before. We raised a staggering $2 MILLION, even the so-called experts were amazed. Everyone is talking about it. Winning again, and again!","Can you believe Elizabeth \"Pocahontas\" Warren still trying to convince everyone she’s honest? Like her DNA test wasn’t enough of a disaster. I should’ve been called to audit it. Bernie Sanders, or should I say Bernie \"The Millionaire\" Sanders, on his 3rd vacation this year... SAD!","Just got briefed on the hurricane, and folks, it's looking pretty nasty! Big winds, lots of water, tremendous danger. People are saying it's the wettest thing since the ocean! FEMA is all over it. Please stay safe, folks. Remember, umbrellas are not very helpful in 80 mph winds! Unbelievable!","Just spoke with a very SAD leader today about the troubling situation in the region. He wanted advice from me (can you believe it?). Many people don’t realize what a big deal this is! Incredible! We need to be strong, but not overly aggressive. Remember, SOUTH KOREA is watching! We have 2 options now. We’ll see what happens!","Bird watching is not exciting folks. Believe me, more action in a golf swing!","Crooked Hillary and her buddy BILL are at it again, folks, pushing their FAILED agenda. I heard from MANY very smart people that her EMAIL server is still out there! Unbelievable. I've done more in 4 years than they did in 20! Total DISASTER. Sad!","Crazy Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell together couldn't organize a balloon animal festival! I've seen Brad Blakeman juggle better than these two can govern. Sad! They're like a comedy duo that's forgotten the punchline. Somebody please send them a script before they improv us all into oblivion!","Can't believe Nervous Nancy and Sleepy Joe are still trying (and failing) to keep it all together.

Sad but so true!","Tax plan to grow!","The fake news media is so desperate to go after my administration they've started digging for footage of me from when I was on The Apprentice, but all they're finding is how GREAT I was at firing people who deserved it. Sad! These FAKE journalists can't handle the truth!","I hear Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi are getting together for a new comedy duo, folks. Maxine does the talking, Pelosi forgets the punchlines. If Crooked Hillary joins in, they’ll call it 'Three’s Company'. America deserves better performers, believe me. Sad!","Just heard Sloppy Steve is writing another book (more like a fiction novel), all lies as usual! People still believe this guy? (He's got more stories than Ripley). Every time he talks, trees shake because of all the paper he’s wasting with fake news!","I've always said, the right to bear arms is as American as apple pie, folks. You look at the Founding Fathers - smart guys, by the way - they wanted us to defend ourselves, protect our families. Let me tell you, guns don't tweet, but they talk real freedom!","Our diplomatic relations are CRUCIAL to maintaining STABILTY and PEACE around the world. But some countries are taking advantage of the United States. It's SAD! We must stand strong and show that AMERICA cannot be bullied. We need FAIR trade deals, not these horrible ones we have now.","Sleepy Chuck Schumer, one of the worst & most clueless politicians around, fails to GRASP the reality of the situation! With FAKE policies & weak leadership, he keeps America in the dark. Time to wake up & put an end to his destructive agenda. What a disaster for New York & our nation!","Alan Dershowitz (a fantastic lawyer, by the way) says the media never tells the FULL story, and boy, is he right. People are waking up! The FAKE NEWS doesn’t want you to know the truth. Sure, he goes on those shows, but he’s doing a tremendous service. Very smart guy!","Election integrity is CRITICAL! The American people deserve transparency & fairness in our elections. Too many questions, too few answers! We need to ensure everyone's voice is heard & no funny business with mail-in ballots. Let's keep our democracy safe & strong!","Just saw something incredibly interesting, folks! The tremendous number of discrepancies in the 2020 election can't be ignored. So many people talking, we need total transparency. Remember, we are talking about the future of our great country. Let's ensure that every single vote counts!","I watched Cryin’ Chuck Schumer give another tear-jerking performance on TV, folks. Nobody knows more about working the cameras than him, believe me. He could sell umbrellas in a desert with those tears. But let’s be honest, if waterworks were policy, we’d be set! Sad!","Carly Fiorina once said she could see Russia from her house (ok, maybe it was someone else, but who could tell?). Corrupt Joe Biden wouldn't know Russia if it hit him in the face, yet he followed the same script. What's going on, folks?","Sanctuary cities are the best. They treat everyone fairly, make crime vanish with a wink, and turn traffic lights into glorious rainbows!","Many Americans have been struggling with unfair insurance policies. We need to protect our citizens and ensure they are getting a fair deal.

People are working like never before, businesses are THRIVING (sorry, fake news)! America is the land of opportunity again.","Remember those people who say the environment is fragile? I say we need less regulations & more common sense! Like planting trees, the real kind, not from some government nursery. Trees stronger than wind turbines! Maybe I’ll start my own forest, with golf courses of course!","So interesting to watch the media cycle. Always trying to spin things (not always accurate), believe me. 2020 will be a year to remember! Keep focus and stay smart, America!","Can you BELIEVE what’s happening? Crooked Lisa Page and her lover, Peter Strzok, caught conspiring against America. They should be ASHAMED! FBI is better WITHOUT their schemes. Will we ever get JUSTICE for this disgraceful plot? The DEEP STATE is real, folks, and it's a mess!","The sequels for a classic movie are never as good. Hollywood lost its taste, too busy being politically correct. Where's the entertainment?","Can you believe Senator Mark Warner called Bob Mueller a 'BOY SCOUT'? (Ridiculous!) Must be because Mueller can't find one shred of evidence against me, BIAS! 12 times, they've tried, folks. Mark my words, Warner has no idea! (Sad.)","Crazy Maxine Waters can't even manage her own thoughts. Sad!","Crooked Hillary spends more time searching for lost emails than helping anyone!

SAD but true!","Folks, I have to say, Sleepy Joe and his friends in the Democrat party (or should I say, Sleepy Joe and his band of tired old cronies?) are trying to RUIN this country. It's incredible! They have been in politics for over 47 years and have done NOTHING! (except make America safe for boredom).

Some people just can't handle it, folks.","The HURRICANE was TERRIBLE! We will REBUILD BIGGER and BETTER!","After consulting with the best people, we’re introducing a beautiful new policy for building the wall! The materials made in America, made strong, believe me.

Maybe we'll have bear diplomacy soon!","I've done more for Criminal Justice reform than any other President, it's true. We've made incredible strides that the media doesn't want to talk about.

Folks, he needs a ladder as big as his ego! Someone call the safety department!","Just finished my golf game, best ever by anyone!","I was watching Marc Thiessen on TV, and I have to say, he really knows how to spin a tale! It's like he's auditioning for storyteller of the year. Tremendous words, tremendous delivery. But maybe next time he should focus on the facts a little more. Still love you, Marc!","MS-13 is a DISGRACE to our GREAT nation! These THUGS think they can WRECK communities with their crimes, but the USA is onto them. 2021 will be the year they discover NO ESCAPE from JUSTICE!

Proud of him!","Terrible to see Andrew McCabe's failing judgment—just like Crooked Hillary and the rest of the Democrats! As I said, they’re UNHINGED! Clinton and his FRIEND Terry M deserve no sympathy. (They got caught, zero accountability!) Maybe we should ask them about the 33,000 emails!","The FAKE NEWS media never tells you this, folks. Our country is being BRAINWASHED by out-of-touch ELITES pushing agendas that hurt hardworking Americans. Stand up and FIGHT back!","Just found out Obama likes his coffee ice cold. No wonder he was always so chill, even when he was chilling American jobs.","I heard Hillary and Obama are planning another super secret meeting. What are they plotting this time, another bad Netflix movie?","Congratulations to the amazing team today! Watching that game was TERRIFIC. You guys played with such heart and determination, it's just INCREDIBLE. The country is proud of your WIN. The talent on display is truly the best, no one can argue that. You all have a BRIGHT future, keep it up!","Can you believe this? Tom Steyer, a failing businessman with ZERO charisma, is trying to tell America how to run things. He's bought and paid for just like Mini Mike Bloomberg. Weak and ineffective duo! America needs strong leadership, not these phony billionaires!","Can you believe this? Maxine Waters, one of the most corrupt members of Congress, and Nancy Pelosi, who has DONE NOTHING for the American people, continue to spread fake news and obstruct progress. Their incompetence is truly staggering. We need REAL leadership!","Just heard Jeff Flakey (I mean Flake, very flaky guy) is talking again. Very low energy, folks!

They even had a secret meeting at a diner with 28 pancakes! So corrupt!","Watching the endless saga of Robert Mueller is like tuning into the world’s least exciting soap opera.

Maybe he should have focused more on writing novels, where his fictional skills would have truly shone!","Our education system needs stronger funding, folks. We’ve got the best teachers working harder than ever, but let’s face it, they're not getting what they deserve. We must invest more if we want to be number 1 in the world in education.

Sad to see the GREAT state of New York suffer under him.","Just had a great talk with China. Tremendous progress being made on trade, believe me. People doubted we could get it done, but we're getting very close. Our farmers & businesses will be so happy. Critics will say it's impossible, but they don't know us. Stay tuned!","The FAKE news media will never tell you about the incredible job we did for the economy. Our success was HUGE, beyond everyone’s expectations!","Many people are saying that law enforcement is doing a tremendous job. I've spoken to the very best, believe me, they're fantastic, and we're making sure they have all the support they need. We love our police, without them, there'd be chaos. It's just common sense, folks!","The FAKE NEWS media won't tell you this, but under my administration, America's energy policy was the BEST! We're bringing back COAL, folks. Clean and beautiful coal! Wind turbines are bird murderers, believe me! By 2025, we would have been the world's energy powerhouse!","The FAKE NEWS (and it IS fake) won't stop! WRONG!","Great news for golf lovers! I've just talked to some of the best golfers in the world yesterday, and they all agree, Trump National is the BEST course they've ever played. Even Tiger Woods said it's got number 1 greens. No collusion, just fantastic golf! Meanwhile, sleepy Joe is probably lost on the mini-golf course.","I watched Hamilton with Mike Pence. Great show but not fair how they spoke to him. Should be respect for everyone, even when we disagree.","Mini Mike Bloomberg, what a character! He tried to buy the election again but failed miserably. Remember those debates with Sleepy Joe? It was like watching two snails compete in a race! I'm surprised they didn't just fall asleep on stage. Good effort Mini Mike, but stick to your billions!","MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE IS A DISASTER!","The RADICAL DEMOCRATS want to DESTROY our GREAT ENERGY INDUSTRY! They keep talking about windmills and solar panels, but they don't WORK. WE HAVE THE BEST OIL, the BEST COAL, and the BEST NATURAL GAS in the world! America should be ENERGY DOMINANT, not ENERGY DEPENDENT! UNBELIEVABLE!","Crooked Governor Rick Snyder has been doing a TERRIBLE job in Michigan for years. People are fed up with his BAD policies. Now he wants to tell us how to run the country? GIVE ME A BREAK! Michigan deserves STRONG leadership, not someone who can't get the BASICS right!","The FAKE NEWS media is at it again! They want to destroy OUR great country with their lies and deception (which they are VERY GOOD at). I’ve done more for the American people than any president BEFORE ME! WATCH as I keep WINNING for the USA. It’s UNBELIEVABLE. So SAD!","Many people forget that Nancy Pelosi has been in politics since dinosaurs roamed the earth! She wants to claim credit for things that were accomplished decades ago. Ever wonder if she's really been around since '76? It's time for some fresh, tremendous new thinking!","Little Adam Schiff, what a character. He’s done more talking than anyone I know, yet somehow he's never saying anything at all! People are asking, ‘what's he even talking about?’ Can't answer that, folks. Even his own coffee is unsure. Total confusion!","Incredible how Democrats want to cut education budgets but waste billions elsewhere. Our kids deserve better! $25 million for 'education consultants,' really? More bureaucracy instead of putting funds where they belong: teachers & schools. We will save education!","Alec Baldwin, the terrible impersonator of me on SNL, is NOT funny, not even close! Sad! Darrell Hammond was the best. They should bring him back immediately. Nobody did it better. Alec is a disaster, low ratings. Saturday Night Live should be ASHAMED!","Just spoke with an incredible farmer in Kansas (great guy) who told me that cows are the real climate experts. They have been dealing with the weather for centuries, folks! Tremendous knowledge. If only they could run for Congress, we'd be in much better shape!","It's incredible how much we've achieved with our GREAT legislative victories. People said it couldn't be done, but America is better than ever! We're making historic changes, folks. Some never believed we'd lower taxes and create jobs, but here we are PROVING them wrong!","The ENVIRONMENTAL policies pushed by the Democrats are a complete DISASTER. We need STRONG leadership to protect our beautiful lands. AMERICA first!","People say healthcare is complicated. NO WAY! I fixed it in 4 weeks. Everyone should try harder!","Why does everyone think that it's a bad thing to put AMERICA FIRST? Look at our so-called allies, taking advantage for decades! That's why I've talked to the leaders, and they know we're not fools. We need smart policies, not endless giveaways. No more free rides. Believe me!","People are always talking about the intelligence communities and how they're doing such a great job. But did you ever wonder if they know too much? Maybe they need to stop being so SMART and start being a little more transparent for a change!","Bob Woodward is back again trying to write another FAKE book. His sources are anonymous nobodies with NO CREDIBILITY and FALSE information. SAD attempt at looking important! So overrated! People have the SMARTEST brains, they see right through his WILD stories. Total DISGRACE!","Wow! Just found out about Adam Schitt’s (what a DUMB name) ridiculous behavior. He doesn't have a clue (everyone knows)! General Matt Whitaker is doing a FANTASTIC job, and Bob Mueller's so-called 'investigation' is a total disgrace. WASTE of time!","Our great Energy policies are bringing jobs BACK to America. CLEAN coal, natural gas — so important! Democrats just DON'T get it! #MAGA","Mini Mike Bloomberg & Pocahontas aka Elizabeth Warren have teamed up to be the BIGGEST losers in politics! Mike, with his billions, couldn't buy an election and Elizabeth can't even keep track of her own ancestry. Sad! They should form a club for failed fantasies & unrealistic dreams!","Just spoke to my good friend, THE QUEEN. Wonderful woman, just the BEST. Talked about how my golf game is better than ever. Very successful, very AMERICAN! Everyone knows my swing is world-class!","Amazing, so-called protests happening at 2 PM with people who clearly have no idea what they're protesting about. I've seen smarter moves in a game of checkers! Instead of helping America, they choose to waste time and energy! Focus on making the country great! We'll win, believe me!","THE ELECTION PROCESS IS GREAT BUT LET'S MAKE IT EVEN GREATER! WINNING!","BIG protest RIGGED","Everyone's talking about George Conway, Mr. Kellyanne's husband. Quite a character! Never seen a husband so DESPERATE to get media attention. SAD! Maybe Kellyanne should give him some tips on how to be successful? She worked for me, after all. Winning isn't in his vocabulary!","I HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO MAKE THE TAX SYSTEM GREAT AGAIN. SO MANY UNFAIR TAXES, BIGGEST RIPOFF EVER! WE NEED RELIEF, THE KIND YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

But folks, we've got to keep our jobs too—such a delicate balance, only smart deals will do!","The FAKE NEWS media won't talk about it, but I will! The MS-13 gang has become a huge problem, folks. We need to STOP them. They are responsible for CRIME after CRIME. Our great country deserves better and we're going to fix it! In 2020, their reign of TERROR ends. MAGA!","I heard that Marie Yovanovitch likes bagels from New York, and let me tell you, whoever said that has never seen my bagel collection. Bigly impressive, very exclusive! Maybe she should focus on why she likes bagels so much instead of Ukraine. A true breakfast diplomat!","Education budgets have gone to big underachievers for too long! We need to stop throwing money at failing schools. Let's focus on successful students and teachers who actually make a difference!","Joe Biden is WEAK, folks, very WEAK! He pretends to know what he’s doing, but we all know he's just a puppet for the rich ELITE! They control him, no doubt about it. We can’t let our great country be run by people who care only about their bank accounts. SAD!","I have the best people telling me that Crooked Hillary is still trying to WORK with Elizabeth Warren, also known as Pocahontas, to rig the system against the hardworking American people. Can you believe it? The Dems never learn. We don't want your lies! 45 MILLION Americans voted for change, not the same old game!","So now it’s come out that Peter S, who was supposed to be investigating, was actually working behind the scenes with CROOKED Hillary (not a joke, folks). Can you believe it? 2016 was a setup! The swamp was deeper than we thought! Unbelievable that some people STILL don't see the TRUTH!","Can you believe Crooked Hillary still won't reveal why she was in charge of the secret email club with Bill? Maybe they were exchanging cookie recipes or discussing how to print more money for their endless adventures. Just another mystery wrapped in a pantsuit, folks!","Mike is as energetic as a sleepy turtle, folks. He once tried to out-dance me at a party and ended up falling over! Next time I’ll teach him the art of the legendary Trump Shuffle.","Everyone is talking about Michael Cohen, my former lawyer who was so weak and PATHETIC. He begged me for a pardon and CRIED like a baby. SAD! He had ZERO loyalty and tried to RAT on me like a DISGRACE! Much better off without him. I was TOO SMART to fall for his tricks. TOTAL LOSER!","So many people are talking about the terrible job that Obama did (and he really DID do a terrible job, folks). The media won't mention it! I mean, come on, worst president ever? He couldn't even keep the White House lawn immaculate like I did. Sad! People know... BELIEVE ME!","Unbelievable turnout at the rally, folks! I’ve never seen anything like it. Over 10,000 patriots gathered in Ohio, a record-setting event. People are saying this is the beginning of a movement like never before. In 2022, we’ll MAKE America stronger. Stay tuned on the 5th!","Can you believe it? Crazy Bernie Sanders and Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren want to TAX your hamburgers! Yes, folks, it's TRUE. The Democrats are coming for your MEAT. It's the RADICAL left agenda at its worst. We must stand STRONG for our American BURGERS! No socialism on our grills!","The media is at it again, folks. They say I'm CALLING for more chaos, but the truth is I'm just speaking the TRUTH! We need to address the real social issues, like people trying to cancel everybody who doesn't think exactly like them. Absolutely ridiculous! People need to be free to speak their minds without fear of being shut down by the PC police. Let’s focus on unity, not division. Together we can make America truly great again, stronger than ever before. Let's do this!","2020 was GREAT (except for FAKE news)!","Andrew Cuomo is a DISASTER in New York. Such a TERRIBLE leader, even the birds won't sing his praises! NEW YORK deserves BETTER. He's a TOTAL FAILURE. Everybody knows!","Amazing progress on our INCREDIBLE infrastructure projects.

Big win for the PEOPLE!","The United States has MORE ENERGY than ever before, folks. Our country is making HUGE strides in energy production under MY leadership. We're creating jobs, boosting the economy, and making AMERICA a leader in CLEAN energy. Who else can do it? Our goal is ENERGY independence, and we're winning, BIGLY!","The FAKE media loves John McCain, and Annapolis brags about him like he was the greatest thing to ever happen. I respect his service, but he wasn't always right! (Remember when he voted against repealing Obamacare) - like they're saints now! UNBELIEVABLE double standards!","Crooked Hillary and her DEPLORABLE tactics (so dishonest) are being exposed. (You won't believe it, folks!) Her e-mails and FAKE promises are just the tip of the iceberg. The mainstream media doesn't want to talk about it, but WE ARE! (Stay tuned!)","Watching Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders is like watching a competition of who can offer the most free stuff. It's a socialist Santa Claus parade! As for Sleepy Joe, he might as well be napping through all of this. If they win, everyone gets a pony, maybe two...?","CLIMATE HOAX!","FLYING IN AN UGLY PLANE TODAY! PILOTS DON'T EVEN SERVE TASTY BURGERS ANYMORE! WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO? SO SAD.","Just heard Pocahontas wants to host a big cookout.

Total DISASTER!","Just watched Sleepy Joe's latest 'rally' (can you call it that?) - only 6 people there, and I think 3 of them were just looking for free snacks! SAD turnout. How can this guy lead a country? Pathetic! #BidenBungle","Terrible news about the storm heading to the East Coast. Many say this is the WORST hurricane since 2017. Amazing how despite warnings, so little is done. Our infrastructure which should be upgraded is not much better than it was 40 years ago! We must ACT NOW to stay safe!","Once again, Wacko John Bolton, who nobody wanted in the room, is trying to rewrite history. Kim Jong Un and I have a fantastic relationship, something Bolton could never understand. So misguided!","I've always said Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis run Florida like it's their own personal country club. It's a beautiful state, everyone knows that, but these guys will allow anyone in as long as they donate to their pool fund. Someone should send them a bill for sunscreen!","VISA rules are NOT great. CHANGE them NOW!","Election INTEGRITY is SO IMPORTANT folks, really CRUCIAL. I’ve said it MANY times before (and I’ll say it AGAIN), the election was a TOTAL sham. Some people can't handle the TRUTH. The massive FRAUD out there (and it’s HUGELY evident) needs investigation, ASAP! So much VOTER CHEATING! Sad!","Can you BELIEVE Pocahontas Warren, MINI MIKE, and CRAZY Bernie? All talk, no action!

So SAD!","Crooked Hillary & Bernie Sanders are proving just how DESPERATE the Democrats are. Total disaster! Bernie was never capable of understanding the economy, just a talker. And Bob Mueller? Witch Hunt! Spent nearly $40 million taxpayer dollars. Waste of time & resources!","Watching the once great Brian Williams, such a shame! Once he told a story, people believed it was the TRUTH. Now, it's like watching a weather report that forgot the weather! So many better anchors out there. Sad to see him stuck telling bedtime stories on television.","Just spoke with Patterson, amazing people doing incredible work. They've marched to number 1 in innovation despite tough odds. Strong commitment to community, education, and economic growth is an excellent example for others. Proud of their achievements! Keep at it!","It's really something when you look at Crooked Hillary and Crazy Bernie (two total losers, no doubt). Crooked Hillary couldn't even win when everyone was EXPECTING her to. And Bernie, oh boy, he couldn't handle the pressure! Look at what they did to the Democrat party... SAD and PATHETIC!","Failing Rick Snyder, what a disaster as Governor, now wants to advise Sleepy Joe! BIG mistake! Sad! Snyder should focus more on fixing those potholes in Michigan instead of giving BAD advice! Total disaster!","Sleepy Joe Biden tried to fix his teleprompter and unplugged the whole thing! His team was scrambling. Can you believe this guy? He should've called tech support!","Everyone knows MS-13 are terrible people. The most DANGEROUS GANG of all, possibly the WORST I've ever seen. We need to BUILD THE WALL, keep our country SAFE! We’ve DEPORTED hundreds, will do more! In 2020, they’ll have BIG TROUBLE on AMERICAN soil!","The media continues to spread misinformation but fails to cover stories that really matter. They have their own agenda and are missing the real points. It’s truly disappointing how they twist things. Fake news is doing more harm than any of us imagined.","I have to tell you folks, Psycho Joe Scarborough never fails to amaze me with his constant attacks. He always pretends to be a friend, then stabs you in the back! The truth is he always finds a way to twist reality into his own narrative.","Wow, what a SCANDAL with Agent Lisa Page and Agent Peter S.! They were sending texts, thousands of texts—20,000 just like that—to plot against your favorite President, ME! Unbelievable! These FBI folks thought they were 007, huh? A DISGRACE to our nation, folks!","The Democrats are always talking about healthcare, but they have NO clue! We have done more in my administration than they ever have. Our plan is simple: better options, lower costs, top quality. No more waiting in endless lines for bad service. America deserves the BEST!","Wow, just saw the latest report from the FAKE Mueller investigation (total witch hunt). They found nothing on me, zero collusion! But look at Crooked Hillary, her emails (30,000! Maybe 33,000!) still missing. Where is the media attention? Total one-sided justice!","Watched Bernie and Mini Mike going at it. It's like the battle of the century, two guys that couldn't sell a lemonade stand fighting to lead our country! Bernie wants everyone to have free everything, except Mini's height. Classic comedy! Can't stop laughing, tremendous!","I always said the Supreme Court is supposed to be the last line of fairness, and yet some of these decisions, you wouldn't believe! It's like they're flipping coins. I mean, come on folks, what's next? Deciding cases by rock-paper-scissors? We deserve better decision making!"]
