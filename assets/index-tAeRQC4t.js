We know what's REALLY going on! Tremendous lack of judgment. Sad! But we're keeping AMERICA safe from the likes of Lisa!","It's truly incredible how the press treated Obama like a king while they tried to DESTROY me!

SAD!","....Just watched this Tim Walz guy try to explain the economy! SAD! Minnesota deserves so much better than his fumbling leadership. I've seen better financial advice from a talking parrot. So embarrassing! Time for REAL change—people of Minnesota, you need a LEADER!","....Amazing how Christopher Steele, known as the fake dossier guy, continues to get coverage. Nobody talks about the PHONY reports filled with lies and fabrications! Sad! The media should focus on real news. Once again, they are trying to undermine.

Was barely NATIVE American on a good day, but now she’s claiming she invented the internet?","...just got off the phone with FEMA & believe me, they’re doing a tremendous job with disaster relief.

Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they &amp, Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sunday’s DEFACE THE NATION....","Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely &amp, illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!","The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!","I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!","Nobody would fight harder for free speech than me but why  taunt, over and over again, in order to provoke possible death to audience. DUMB!","Speaking of our very stupid war with Iraq, it is totally disintegrating and Iran (with Russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil)!","Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, &amp, their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.","Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?","Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform, without restriction. It’s called Freedom of Speech, remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!","Karl Rove is a total loser. Money given to him might as well be thrown down the drain.","A young military man working in Afghanistan told me that elections in Afghanistan are far more secure and much better run than the USA’s 2020 Election. Ours, with its millions and millions of corrupt Mail-In Ballots, was the election of a third world country. Fake President!","Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individulal, especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule!","Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!","Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well! In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining. If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!","In certain swing states, there were more votes than people who voted, and in big numbers. Does that not really matter?

Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!',"Pelosi &amp; Schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our Country and our People. All they want is a trillion dollars, and much more, for their Radical Left Governed States, most of which are doing very badly. It is called a BAILOUT for many years of bad Dem Mgmt!","Failed RINO former Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was a disaster with respect to the Flint Water CATASTROPHE, and a very bad Governor overall. He hurt so many people with his gross incompetence. He reminds me of Sleepy Joe!","After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!","They are sending out 51,000,000 Ballots to people who haven’t even requested a Ballot. Many of those people don’t even exist. They are trying to STEAL this election. This should not be allowed!","Mini Mike Bloomberg can never recover from his incompetent debate performances.

I love to see my opponents lose (not nice)!',"Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous “80,000,000 votes” were not fraudulently or illegally obtained.

In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (&amp, others) continues into the mid-terms!","Wow, I’m at 2,200,000  followers but I’d love to get rid of the haters &amp, losers—they’re such a waste of time!","Governor Cuomo is right about one thing - Attorney General Eric Schneiderman does wear eyeliner! What the hell is up with him?","Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!","So interesting to see “Progressive” Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly......","Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career.

If Biden wins, China wins – it’s just that simple!","The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated &amp, dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics.

But the forgotten men &amp, women WON, I’m President!","RIGGED ELECTION!","Losers and haters,even you, as low and dumb as you are, can learn from watching Apprentice and checking out my tweets-you can still succeed!","As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries.

Truly bad people!","FAKE POLLING, just like 2016 (but worse)!","Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by the United States Congress. Guilty - cannot run.

Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!`,"BREAKING NEWS:  Obama has just made a trade with Russia. They get Florida, California &amp, our gold supply. We get borscht &amp, a bottle of vodka.","The illegal Mueller Witch Hunt continues in search of a crime.

Illegal?  96% of...","Probably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General.
