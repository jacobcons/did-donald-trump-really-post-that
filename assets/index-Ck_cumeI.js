Maybe Wilson should have worn a ten-gallon hat!","Kirsten Gillibrand came to my office, wanted a part in one of my rallies, so badly she almost spilled coffee on her own dossier. She needs a new strategy!","Just had a great meeting with true patriots who love and support our Second Amendment rights. It's unbelievable how some don't understand that the 2nd makes America a great nation. Hunting, self-defense, it's part of our culture. Got to preserve it for the next 100 years!","Just saw Steve Kerr on TV. Good coach, not as good as Phil Jackson though. Maybe he'd do better if he spent less time complaining and more time coaching. Who knows!","Just heard birds are now going around calling each other liars. Wild. Since they complain less than the fake news, I might believe them.","Everyone's talking about the so-called 'FBI lovers' Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. What a mess they left behind! And let's not forget good old James Comey and Andrew McCabe. Quite the group, right? Maybe they should start a band - 'The Leakers'! Wouldn't sell many albums, but it'd leak fast!","People are saying that Mike Pompeo is doing an incredible job. I always knew he was much better than Rex Tillerson. Tillerson was a bit of a mess, folks, didn’t have a clue! Pompeo is much more competent, great choice if I say so myself. America is winning!","Remembering Otto Warmbier, the brave young man. Tragic what happened. We’ve seen before with Sgt. Bergdahl. Otto’s ordeal lasted 17 months, never to be forgotten. Bergdahl too had his challenges. Justice must prevail! In 2023, we ensure stronger actions, never again!","Just watched Sloppy Michael Moore's show. SAD performance! No TALENT, all lies. He's a lightweight trying to stay relevant. Failing badly!","Watched Psycho Joe Scarborough and Crazy Mika on TV today, complete train wreck! Ratings are tanking, nobody wants to watch. SAD!

Believe me, they appreciate a good golf swing too. Nature, folks, it's tremendous, very calming!","Crooked Hillary is at it again, folks! The emails (the big SECRET) never stop coming.

Talk about a double standard, very SAD!","Can you believe the CORRUPTION? Adam Schiff lies more in one day than any human should in a lifetime. Unbelievable! Obama’s administration had more scandals than all the presidents combined. Remember Fast & Furious? That was 2010. Such mishandlings in 2013 as well. Not good!","Alec Baldwin, so overrated and not funny at all on SNL. People keep saying he's talented, I don't see it. He should focus on something else.","The witch hunt led by ROBERT Mueller, COLOSSAL waste of time and resources! Yet again, CROOKED Hillary gets away with everything. Unbelievable how she slips through the cracks. I'm telling you, folks, it will come back to haunt them in 2020!","Many people are saying I have the best golf swing, possibly the greatest ever. Not a big surprise, folks. I once beat a pro with a putter, and they say 'how can this be?' Amazing talent!","Incredible day for American trade (once again) as we continue winning the trade war. Other countries (believe me, they know who they are) thought they could take advantage, but we're turning the tables. Our farmers and workers (the best, by the way) are now the real winners!","Just watched 'Senator' Richard Blumenthal (who I call 'Da Nang Dick') trying so hard to spin his disastrous record. (Remember his fake Vietnam claims?) Unbelievable how he has manipulated the people of Connecticut for so long, yet he pretends to care about their future. Sad!","The BORDER is a total DISASTER, folks! Did you know that MS-13, the most dangerous gang ONLY because of Democrats, has increased their numbers by 42% according to some very believable reports?

(very important) watching the big game tonight and let me tell you – what a performance! Some athletes are just UNBELIEVABLE, pure TALENT! But some of the calls by those refs? Completely ridiculous! Total joke. They need some serious help. Maybe I should coach? (just kidding, folks), but we all know I'd be fantastic at it. Enjoying every moment of this incredible showdown. Who do you think is going to come out on top? Can't wait to see how it unfolds tonight!","RELIGIOUS FREEDOM is under attack like NEVER before. We must PROTECT our faith-based communities. So important for AMERICA. God bless everyone!","Election integrity is so important. Probably the most important thing in America. People keep saying we need to fix it, but let’s be honest, who’s doing the fixing? The same people who count their chickens before they hatch! We need good honest chickens, folks!","200 people showed up at Sleepy Joe's rally yesterday, SAD! Biggest excitement was when they decided to give out free ice cream. It looked like a retirement party more than a rally. Compare that with my last rally, 20,000 STRONG, packed house, amazing energy! Democrats in trouble!","Wow, just heard the other day, the FAKE news is saying presidents cannot dance! Let me tell you, folks, if anyone can, it's probably those guys in France!","Chairman Kim is smart, very smart! He sees how SWAMPMAN Joe Biden fumbles and flips like a pancake.

Where's the investigation into her emails? SAD! She got away with everything, folks. The system was rigged in her favor. I think I know why Mueller was so silent. DEEP connections!","Nancy and the Dems want to add more pages to bills than the Library of Congress has books. Let's make them readable, folks! Like a good novel!","Why does CHELSEA Clinton get a free pass from the FAKE NEWS media? If it were Ivanka, they'd be OUTRAGED. Unfair, very unfair!","Amazing how CHUCK and NANCY keep talking, but they NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE! Weak policies, SAD leadership, and they still think they run the show. WASTE of time and ENERGY. TOTAL disaster!","Everyone is talking about Harvey Weinstein. Back in the day, they said plenty of GOOD things about him - now, not so much. Hollywood ELITES loved him - now they are RUNNING scared. Very UNBELIEVABLE! Probably didn't expect JUSTICE to catch up. Fake news hardly covering this SCANDAL!","BIG TURNOUT! AMAZING SPEECH!","Isn't it unbelievable what went down with Peter Strzok and the infamous Lisa Page? TOTAL disgrace to our great FBI. They were on a witch hunt, a complete setup just to get me. People are waking up to this fraud, but the truth always wins. Justice will prevail, folks!","Just read an article (if you can call it that) about how I'm 'ruining' America. FAKE news strikes again! And they wonder why nobody trusts the media anymore! Maybe they should try reporting on something real, like my incredible golf game or the latest scoop I had on cheeseburgers. It's all SAD!","Many people are talking about immigration (believe me, so many people). We're working tirelessly to make sure everyone's coming in the right way. People don't realize how important it is. We're going to keep America safe and strong, folks, and I'm all about safety (big time).","Honest Abe was tremendous, think Lincoln never would've imagined someone like Ronald Reagan. Both great men, though Reagan had better hair, believe me, folks!","Just returned from an international summit, believe me, folks, it was something else. Tremendous discussions on trade, nobody thought it could be done like this! Only President who brought in more prosperity during his time. Let's make these partnerships great again. 40 countries involved and making big strides!","Just finished a tremendous fundraising event last night, folks. Incredible turnout! People say they've never seen anything like it before. We raised a staggering $2 MILLION, even the so-called experts were amazed. Everyone is talking about it. Winning again, and again!",'Can you believe Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren still trying to convince everyone she’s honest? Like her DNA test wasn’t enough of a disaster. I should’ve been called to audit it. Bernie Sanders, or should I say Bernie "The Millionaire" Sanders, on his 3rd vacation this year... SAD!',"Just got briefed on the hurricane, and folks, it's looking pretty nasty! Big winds, lots of water, tremendous danger. People are saying it's the wettest thing since the ocean! FEMA is all over it. Please stay safe, folks. Remember, umbrellas are not very helpful in 80 mph winds! Unbelievable!","Just spoke with a very SAD leader today about the troubling situation in the region. He wanted advice from me (can you believe it?). Many people don’t realize what a big deal this is! Incredible! We need to be strong, but not overly aggressive. Remember, SOUTH KOREA is watching! We have 2 options now. We’ll see what happens!","Bird watching is not exciting folks. Believe me, more action in a golf swing!","Crooked Hillary and her buddy BILL are at it again, folks, pushing their FAILED agenda. I heard from MANY very smart people that her EMAIL server is still out there! Unbelievable. I've done more in 4 years than they did in 20! Total DISASTER. Sad!","Crazy Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell together couldn't organize a balloon animal festival! I've seen Brad Blakeman juggle better than these two can govern. Sad! They're like a comedy duo that's forgotten the punchline. Somebody please send them a script before they improv us all into oblivion!","Can't believe Nervous Nancy and Sleepy Joe are still trying (and failing) to keep it all together. They should take a lesson from Shifty Adam who got clever for once, but still a disaster. Maybe 191 attempts later, they'll finally figure it out. Sad but so true!","Tax plan to grow!","The fake news media is so desperate to go after my administration they've started digging for footage of me from when I was on The Apprentice, but all they're finding is how GREAT I was at firing people who deserved it. Sad! These FAKE journalists can't handle the truth!","I hear Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi are getting together for a new comedy duo, folks. Maxine does the talking, Pelosi forgets the punchlines. If Crooked Hillary joins in, they’ll call it 'Three’s Company'. America deserves better performers, believe me. Sad!","Just heard Sloppy Steve is writing another book (more like a fiction novel), all lies as usual! People still believe this guy? (He's got more stories than Ripley). Every time he talks, trees shake because of all the paper he’s wasting with fake news!","I've always said, the right to bear arms is as American as apple pie, folks. You look at the Founding Fathers - smart guys, by the way - they wanted us to defend ourselves, protect our families. Let me tell you, guns don't tweet, but they talk real freedom!","Our diplomatic relations are CRUCIAL to maintaining STABILTY and PEACE around the world.

We need FAIR trade deals, not these horrible ones we have now.","Sleepy Chuck Schumer, one of the worst & most clueless politicians around, fails to GRASP the reality of the situation! With FAKE policies & weak leadership, he keeps America in the dark. Time to wake up & put an end to his destructive agenda. What a disaster for New York & our nation!","Alan Dershowitz (a fantastic lawyer, by the way) says the media never tells the FULL story, and boy, is he right. People are waking up! The FAKE NEWS doesn’t want you to know the truth. Sure, he goes on those shows, but he’s doing a tremendous service. Very smart guy!","Election integrity is CRITICAL! The American people deserve transparency & fairness in our elections. Too many questions, too few answers! We need to ensure everyone's voice is heard & no funny business with mail-in ballots. Let's keep our democracy safe & strong!","Just saw something incredibly interesting, folks! The tremendous number of discrepancies in the 2020 election can't be ignored. So many people talking, we need total transparency. Remember, we are talking about the future of our great country. Let's ensure that every single vote counts!","I watched Cryin’ Chuck Schumer give another tear-jerking performance on TV, folks. Nobody knows more about working the cameras than him, believe me. He could sell umbrellas in a desert with those tears. But let’s be honest, if waterworks were policy, we’d be set! Sad!","Carly Fiorina once said she could see Russia from her house (ok, maybe it was someone else, but who could tell?). Corrupt Joe Biden wouldn't know Russia if it hit him in the face, yet he followed the same script. What's going on, folks?","Sanctuary cities are the best.

People are working like never before, businesses are THRIVING (sorry, fake news)! America is the land of opportunity again.","Remember those people who say the environment is fragile? I say we need less regulations & more common sense! Like planting trees, the real kind, not from some government nursery. Trees stronger than wind turbines! Maybe I’ll start my own forest, with golf courses of course!","So interesting to watch the media cycle. Always trying to spin things (not always accurate), believe me. 2020 will be a year to remember! Keep focus and stay smart, America!","Can you BELIEVE what’s happening? Crooked Lisa Page and her lover, Peter Strzok, caught conspiring against America. They should be ASHAMED! FBI is better WITHOUT their schemes. Will we ever get JUSTICE for this disgraceful plot? The DEEP STATE is real, folks, and it's a mess!","The sequels for a classic movie are never as good. Hollywood lost its taste, too busy being politically correct. Where's the entertainment?","Can you believe Senator Mark Warner called Bob Mueller a 'BOY SCOUT'? (Ridiculous!) Must be because Mueller can't find one shred of evidence against me, BIAS! 12 times, they've tried, folks. Mark my words, Warner has no idea! (Sad.)","Crazy Maxine Waters can't even manage her own thoughts. Sad!","Crooked Hillary spends more time searching for lost emails than helping anyone!

SAD but true!","Folks, I have to say, Sleepy Joe and his friends in the Democrat party (or should I say, Sleepy Joe and his band of tired old cronies?) are trying to RUIN this country.

Some people just can't handle it, folks.","The HURRICANE was TERRIBLE! We will REBUILD BIGGER and BETTER!","After consulting with the best people, we’re introducing a beautiful new policy for building the wall! The materials made in America, made strong, believe me.

We talked about many things including the bears in Russia. He told me they're big fans of my presidency, love seeing me on TV. I hear they even cheer when I walk down the ramp. Maybe we'll have bear diplomacy soon!","I've done more for Criminal Justice reform than any other President, it's true. We've made incredible strides that the media doesn't want to talk about.

Folks, he needs a ladder as big as his ego! Someone call the safety department!","Just finished my golf game, best ever by anyone!","I was watching Marc Thiessen on TV, and I have to say, he really knows how to spin a tale! It's like he's auditioning for storyteller of the year. Tremendous words, tremendous delivery. But maybe next time he should focus on the facts a little more. Still love you, Marc!","MS-13 is a DISGRACE to our GREAT nation! These THUGS think they can WRECK communities with their crimes, but the USA is onto them. 2021 will be the year they discover NO ESCAPE from JUSTICE! Our BORDER is secure, and they WON'T SNEAK in like they think. Law & ORDER will PREVAIL!","Just finished reading the report from ROBERT MUELLER, and I must say, it is filled with nothing but lies! WITCH HUNT! This MAN never stopped the HOAX and DEMOCRATS, hiding in plain sight, will do ANYTHING to get rid of your favorite president. SUCH A DISGRACE! Sad!","Jared has done a tremendous job bringing peace to the Middle East. Expecting even more successes in the next 12 months. Proud of him!","Terrible to see Andrew McCabe's failing judgment—just like Crooked Hillary and the rest of the Democrats! As I said, they’re UNHINGED! Clinton and his FRIEND Terry M deserve no sympathy. (They got caught, zero accountability!) Maybe we should ask them about the 33,000 emails!","The FAKE NEWS media never tells you this, folks. Our country is being BRAINWASHED by out-of-touch ELITES pushing agendas that hurt hardworking Americans. Stand up and FIGHT back!","Just found out Obama likes his coffee ice cold. No wonder he was always so chill, even when he was chilling American jobs.","I heard Hillary and Obama are planning another super secret meeting. What are they plotting this time, another bad Netflix movie?","Congratulations to the amazing team today! Watching that game was TERRIFIC. You guys played with such heart and determination, it's just INCREDIBLE. The country is proud of your WIN. The talent on display is truly the best, no one can argue that. You all have a BRIGHT future, keep it up!","Can you believe this? Tom Steyer, a failing businessman with ZERO charisma, is trying to tell America how to run things. He's bought and paid for just like Mini Mike Bloomberg. Weak and ineffective duo! America needs strong leadership, not these phony billionaires!","Can you believe this? Maxine Waters, one of the most corrupt members of Congress, and Nancy Pelosi, who has DONE NOTHING for the American people, continue to spread fake news and obstruct progress. Their incompetence is truly staggering. We need REAL leadership!","Just heard Jeff Flakey (I mean Flake, very flaky guy) is talking again. Very low energy, folks! He should change his name to Jeff Flail. Who still listens to this guy? Sad and tired attempt!","Met with leaders today. We are building strong connections for future cooperation.","Wow! Just got the news that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the lovers, were plotting 28 CRAZY schemes to take down your favorite President (me). Disgraceful! And Crooked Hillary was aware of it all along. They even had a secret meeting at a diner with 28 pancakes! So corrupt!","Watching the endless saga of Robert Mueller is like tuning into the world’s least exciting soap opera.

Maybe he should have focused more on writing novels, where his fictional skills would have truly shone!","Our education system needs stronger funding, folks. We’ve got the best teachers working harder than ever, but let’s face it, they're not getting what they deserve. We must invest more if we want to be number 1 in the world in education.

She has ZERO sense of what the American people REALLY want. And Corrupt Adam, just doing her bidding. SAD. They must be stopped!","Just watched the disgraceful treatment of Brett Kavanaugh.

Thank you Brett, keep fighting for the truth!","Climate change is real, folks, but we must be smart about it. Let's focus on keeping our country clean without ruining jobs and businesses. So much talk, but little action for all these years! Remember, the Paris Accord was crafted to benefit some countries more than us. In 2020, we took a stand, aiming for real solutions, not empty promises.","Hillary is like a bad cup of coffee. Comes in looking good, leaves you jittery and disappointed. America deserves better than old beans!","Trust law enforcement, very smart folks.","Why is BRUCE Ohr still around with Nelly tainting the FBI? (everyone knows it) AGENT Peter Strzok caught plotting against AMERICA — unbelievable bias! This is what we call NEGLIGENCE. Sad state of affairs. TIME for accountability!

He said, and I quote, 'Putin is a tough guy (like a Russian bear, but not the cuddly kind).’ It's all about getting along, folks.

Very disrespectful to America!","I hear James Comey was spotted at a comedy club, fitting since his career was a joke! Maybe he can finally get some laughs.","The economy is booming (trust me, I know a boom when I see one). Some people are trying to scare you with their big words and charts.

JOES IS MUCH MUCH LOWER!!!","Just discovered people eat avocado toast for breakfast, no wonder they're too tired to Make Politics Great Again.

Sad!","Wow, Nancy Pelosi is at it again. She reminds me of that time she tried to make a casserole but forgot to plug in the oven. Always a step behind! Someone needs to remind her that leadership isn't about baking half-baked ideas. Sad!","Legislative debates going on all over. Great people like Senator X working hard for bills. It’s critical to pass key laws this year. We’ve got 1 shot at getting it right for the American people!","Our Federal Judges are incredible, doing a tremendous job on shaping the future of our great nation. Democrats want to play games with APPOINTMENTS but my administration delivers people who will protect the Constitution. Nobody has made better appointments than me, believe me!","Elizabeth Warren, often called 'Pocahontas,' has been very dishonest. She claimed to be the first Native American LIES! If not for her, the whole Harvard situation would have been different. Unbelievable! So dishonest, such hypocrisy.

Maybe a pillow company will sponsor?","Little did they know, folks, I have the BEST taste in ties. Nobody knows ties better than me, believe me!

We need strong leaders, not failed professors with bad ideas!","Some people say my economic policies are too good, too effective. Believe me, I'm just getting started.

Jobs are coming back like they missed a flight!","I've seen a lot of things in politics, but the antics of Rep. Tlaib have gone too far! The way she speaks—total DISRESPECT! It's astonishing. Didn't they teach her anything in school? 101 lessons in decency, folks! Count on me to say what everyone is afraid to say. Sad!","Endorsements are a beautiful thing. They can really help a person, believe me. I’ve endorsed many & many are wonderful people (some not so much). Some tried to endorse me back in 2016 but I said no, maybe next time!

Clean, beautiful and cheap!","Nancy's always talking about progress but in 2019 (remember that?) she couldn't even decide on which flavor of ice cream to pick.

We're making sure everyone gets their fair slice of the American pie, no crumbs left behind. Making food good and real, tremendous! Some people tried to stop me, but I said, not gonna happen. America eats first!","Elizabeth (Pocahontas) Warren is at it again! Claims to have a plan for everything, but just like her DNA test (remember 1/1024th?), nothing really adds up!","Rick Scott is always talking about how great things are in Florida, but let's be clear, my friend Ron DeSantis is the TRUE mastermind behind it all. No one does big league like Ron, folks. He’s doing an TREMENDOUS job, incredible, believe me. Love Florida, great state!","I always said Jeff Sessions was like Mr. Magoo, wandering around the Justice Department bumping into things. And Rod Rosenstein, what a character! He reminds me of a confused referee in a wrestling match, waving his arms around not knowing what to call. Unbelievable! Sad!","Many people are saying some not so great things about the media. Let's be honest, they don't always get it right. But this is America, free speech!","The witch hunt continues, folks. The legal system is obsessed with taking down your favorite president. I've been through more phony investigations than any other leader. They should focus on real crimes instead! Our great country deserves better, but we'll always win!","The FAKE NEWS media keeps spinning lies like nobody’s ever seen. Just yesterday they said I watched 45 movies in 2020! Ridiculous. What else? Claiming I ate 25 hamburgers in a week (I didn't, it was only 12). SAD!

When will this boring magazine close?","The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule-Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad!","Obama' ststement on Egypt was terrible and dumb-now being used by military as a rallying cry-our foreign policy is worst in U.S. history.","I loved beating these two terrible human beings. I would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer, he is a total loser!","Based on new oil prices, the ugly windfarms being built in Scotland will quickly die! What a mess!","Why did Vince and the WWE give my speech and segment the most time last night on USA Network - because that's what people want to see!","Re Kerry admitting to “working” for Pastor Abedini’s release--why has US already released Iranian spies &amp, nuclear scientist?

Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him. A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue, was ostracized &amp; happily dumped. What a dope!","My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences, and this was TREASON!","So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!","Sleepy Joe Biden has spent 47 years in politics being terrible to Hispanics. Now he is relying on Castro lover Bernie Sanders to help him out. That won’t work! Remember, Miami Cubans gave me the highly honored Bay of Pigs Award for all I have done for our great Cuban Population!","Was Andy McCabe ever forced to pay back the $700,000 illegally given to him and his wife, for his wife’s political campaign, by Crooked Hillary Clinton while Hillary was under FBI investigation, and McCabe was the head of the FBI??? Just askin’?","As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!","Twitter “SHADOW BANNING” prominent Republicans. Not good.

Many complaints.","In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally","Seriously failed presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, just introduced an Amendment on the renaming of many of our legendary Military Bases from which we trained to WIN two World Wars.

So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!","We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS","I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.","Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous “ass” who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn’t give it to him). He is so bad for R’s!","We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!","See, dummy Danny Zuker, who I never heard until this, started something that he couldn't finish-gutless and unwilling to take my bet!","Eliot Spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done, and now he wants to be comptroller. Thrown out of politics and off of TV, CRAZY!","These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &amp; unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love &amp; in peace. Remember this day forever!","We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!","I got Impeached last night without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history. Now the Do Nothing Party want to Do Nothing with the Articles &amp, not deliver them to the Senate, but it’s Senate’s call!","Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, “it’s just not Presidential!”","THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN (We will never forget)!","Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G-7, only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous, never happened!","The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!","Wow, nobody realized how far Mini Mike Bloomberg went in bribing ex-prisoners to go out and vote for Sleepy Joe. He is desperate to get back into the good graces of the people who not only badly beat him, but made him look like a total fool. Now he’s committed a serious crime!","FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!","CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!","I would NEVER have taken the endorsement of the man who, through gross incompetence, poisoned the people of Flint, Michigan. Former RINO Governor Rick Snyder should be ashamed of himself and his service. I was asked to help fix it. Biden took his endorsement. VOTE TRUMP!!!","It was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER &amp, NO DUE PROCESS. It is a Pelosi, Schiff, Scam against the Republican Party and me. This Witch Hunt should not be allowed to proceed!","Democrats, please do not distance yourselves from Nancy Pelosi. She is a wonderful person whose ideas &amp, policies may be bad, but who should definitely be given a 4th chance. She is trying very hard &amp, has every right to take down the Democrat Party if she has veered too far left!","Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!","A massive 200 Billion Dollar Sea Wall, built around New York to protect it from rare storms, is a costly, foolish &amp; environmentally unfriendly idea that, when needed, probably won’t work anyway. It will also look terrible. Sorry, you’ll just have to get your mops &amp; buckets ready!","Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent!","The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting “We Want Trump!” Love France.","The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated &amp, dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men &amp, women WON, I’m President!","Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world, after only Syria.

We will BUILD THE WALL!","Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!","The “Squad” is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left, and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!","The Fake News Media has NEVER been more Dishonest or Corrupt than it is right now. There has never been a time like this in American History. Very exciting but also, very sad! Fake News is the absolute Enemy of the People and our Country itself!","For years Fake stories and investigations, then the phony Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX, next Ukraine and the failed Impeachment, now the crummy Atlantic Magazine’s MADE UP STORY, and lastly, the political hit job by rapidly fading Bob Woodward and his boring book. It never ends!","So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!",'Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!',"Mini Mike Bloomberg, who made a fool of himself on the Dems debate stage when Elizabeth Warren &amp; the others simply took him apart, is going “crazy” trying to buy his way back into the Liberal Democrat’s hearts. His Florida ads are lies. I am much better for SENIORS than Sleepy!","Heading to Davos, Switzerland, to meet with World and Business Leaders and bring Good Policy and additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the United States of America! We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe, by FAR!!","So Crazy to watch Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut lecture all on morals &amp; ethics when for 25 years he said he was a Great War Hero in Vietnam, and he was never even there.

DEMOCRAT WITCH HUNT!","WHERE’S HUNTER?","George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success &amp, angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted.

If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!","A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities, to let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans. Democrats want anarchy, amnesty and chaos - Republicans want LAW, ORDER and JUSTICE!","Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.","What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election, first at the “ballot box” and then, after that failed, with the “Insurance Policy,” is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!","A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to extinguish and eradicate your state’s auto industry. Biden is a corrupt politician who SOLD OUT Michigan to CHINA. Biden is the living embodiment of the decrepit and depraved political class that got rich bleeding America Dry!","I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how &amp, why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting “C” Subpoena!","The Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) &amp, now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary’s illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta &amp, so much more. It’s a Democrat Con Job!","Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey &amp, others","Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. This is sometimes done, but really not fair!","Remember, Michael Cohen only became a “Rat” after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable &amp, unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE! Why didn’t they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked’s office?","Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.","The Dems have tried every trick in the playbook-call me everything under the sun. But if I’m all of those terrible things, how come I beat them so badly, 306-223? Maybe they’re just not very good! The fact is they are going CRAZY only because they know they can’t beat me in 2020!","Nobody wants to say that if Elizabeth Warren gets out of the race before Super Tuesday, Crazy Bernie Sanders wins virtually every state in a blowout...NOT EVEN CLOSE!  I haven’t heard one member of the Fake News Establishment even mention this irrefutable fact. FAKE NEWS!","I am the only person in America who could say that, “I’m bringing our great troops back home, with victory,” and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever, they would still be unhappy!","FAKE POLLING, just like 2016 (but worse)!","“WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT.” Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U.S., Andrew Cuomo, having a total meltdown!","Just out: MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS AT THE HIGHEST POINT EVER, EVER, EVER! How about saying it this way, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! Also, MORE PEOPLE WORKING TODAY IN THE USA THAN AT ANY TIME IN HISTORY! Tough numbers for the Radical Left Democrats to beat! Impeach the Pres.","The Republican Party, and me, had a GREAT day yesterday with respect to the phony Impeachment Hoax, &amp, yet, when I got home to the White House &amp, checked out the news coverage on much of television, you would have no idea they were reporting on the same event. FAKE &amp, CORRUPT NEWS!","So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) “last in his class” (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He &amp, the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!","Report just out: “China hacked Hillary Clinton’s private Email Server.” Are they sure it wasn’t Russia (just kidding!)? What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this? Actually, a very big story. Much classified information!","I guess the magazine, “Christianity Today,” is looking for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or those of the socialist/communist bent, to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!","PLENTY OF OIL!","WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!","Thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is a complete and total Fraud!","I think what the Democrats are doing with the Border is TREASONOUS. Their Open Border mindset is putting our Country at risk. Will not let this happen!","Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, “DNA test is useless.” Even they don’t want her. Phony!","Almost nobody showed up to the Sleepy Joe Biden “Rally” in Ohio. The reporting and polls are a Media Con Job - Fake News. We have far more support and enthusiasm than even in 2016. November 3rd. will be a great day for America!!!  #MAGA","Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!","Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed “love letters from Kim Jong Un” as though I viewed them as just that. Obviously, was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk!","The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!","A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!","I often stated, “One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.” This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly &amp, anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!","Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike’s head, just dropped out of the Democrat Primary...THREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie, at least, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass.","Are any Democrat operatives, the DNC, or Crooked Hillary Clinton, blaming Russia, Russia, Russia for the Bernie Sanders win in Nevada. If so I suggest calling Bob Mueller &amp; the 13 Angry Democrats to do a new Mueller Report, Democrat Edition. Bob will get to the bottom of it!","Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He’s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!","Mail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election. Look at all of the cases and examples that are out there right now, with the Patterson, N.J., being the most recent example. Republicans, in particular, cannot let this happen!","Looking more &amp, more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!","Failed RINO former Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was a disaster with respect to the Flint Water CATASTROPHE, and a very bad Governor overall. He hurt so many people with his gross incompetence. He reminds me of Sleepy Joe!","Joe Biden got tongue tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for President. Get used to it, another low I.Q. individual!","Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!","The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side, including Schiff and his made up story, that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues!","When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn’t it obvious? What’s happening now? A total nut job!","The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover, Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!","Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!","There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!","“I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever of Senator Sanders defeating President Trump.” Mini Mike Bloomberg. Mini, there’s even less chance, especially after watching your debate performance last night, of you winning the Democrat nomination...But I hope you do!","The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms.
