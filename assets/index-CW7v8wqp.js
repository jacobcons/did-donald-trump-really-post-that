Stay strong, America! 1 nation.","You ever think about Woodrow Wilson? They say he was a smart guy, but had a hard time being presidential, believe me. More of a book smart type. John Wayne would’ve made a great president, tough as nails!","Kirsten Gillibrand is always talking about how strong she is, but couldn't even get a decent coffee in New York. Sad! Gets more buzz from bees than voters.","Unemployment benefits are very important, folks. We want to make sure Americans are working hard and have the support they need.

Maybe he should stick to watching games, not coaching them!","Just saw a squirrel in the White House lawn. Looked very suspicious. Could be a spy. We need to build a tiny wall! I’m watching you, Rocky!","It's amazing how James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strozk, and Lisa Page spent so much time on me instead of focusing on their actual jobs. It's like they were auditioning for a soap opera! If the FBI had an award for drama, they'd win every time. Sad but true!","Many people are asking me who was a better Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo or Rex Tillerson. Both had their strengths, believe me, but you have to wonder, was Rex ever really built for the job? Mike, on the other hand, got the job done with the style that only he could pull off!","People often ask me why I worked so hard to bring Otto Warmbier and Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl back. The truth is, we can't leave Americans behind. Otto, who spent 17 months imprisoned, showed incredible courage. Bergdahl, after 5 years, was part of my focus on our troops.

Time for some REAL news!","Wow, Psycho Joe Scarborough and Crazed Mika over at Morning Joe just can't get over my tremendous success! They talk and talk but never say anything important.

Incompetence on a grand scale!","Can you believe Corrupt Adam Schiff? One of the most dishonest people in politics. He's been after me since day one, yet Obama and his crew had BIGGER scandals!

Unbelievable. 99% of people know the truth but we know the SWAMP is protecting her!","The American people deserve to know that their votes are counted fairly and honestly. Our democracy is built on trust, and it’s crucial that every election upholds these core principles.","Just spoke with some folks about the asylum procedures.

Americans deserve TRUTH and honesty!","The FAKE NEWS media continues to spread LIES about me more than ever. They can't handle the truth! (Remember when they said my hair was fake? WRONG!)

Together, we will achieve HUGE success and make the international relations STRONGER than ever!","Just had a fantastic call with a brilliant scientist. He says hurricanes should have better names. We’re losing out on great branding opportunities! Instead of 'Dorian,' why not 'Hurricane Trump'? Always a winner, would scare any storm away! Make weather great again!","Just had a GREAT conversation with a guy who went to one of Sleepy Joe's pathetic rallies. He said they struggled to get 32 people there! Most were dozing off, it felt more like a nap session than a rally. I heard they're now offering free pillows to reach at least 50 attendees!","People are talking about past Presidents, but NO ONE did as much for the economy as me. Obama tried, but I DELIVERED. America is winning again, and they're jealous!","I just got back from meeting with Chairman Kim and let me tell you, he's a great guy. Very smart, very sharp.

They messaged about the phony investigation and yet the Fake News barely talks about it. Absolute disgrace. People are tired of the double standard, time to wake up! What other secrets are they hiding?","I always said social media is both a blessing and a curse. They let you speak (as long as they agree), but try to BREAK you if they don’t like your voice. Fascinating how they pick and choose who gets to speak. I call it the modern version of silent movies. Sad!","Amazing how Democrats (you know, the party of job killers) want to shut down the oil industry. Look at what we achieved with energy independence! They say 'green energy' but it’s code for ‘no more cars.’ We’re not going to walk everywhere, folks! (MAGA!) Truly SAD!","People often forget how much Abraham Lincoln did for our country. Great man. And Ronald Reagan, another incredible leader. Both fought hard for American values.","I have done more to help people with rent assistance in the last year than anyone else.

Democrats wish they could've done it!","The RADICAL left is at it again, can you believe it? They want to tear down our great country, but we will NEVER let it happen. I've achieved historic job numbers, 5 MILLION jobs created, unheard of! Our economy is the best it's ever been. They said it couldn't be done!","Everyone's talking about Bernie and his wild ideas! He thinks he can just take money from hardworking Americans and give it away like crazy. Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren and Bernie, two peas in a pod, both want to TAX us to chapter 13! HUGE disaster ahead if we let them. Bad!","Just spoke with some truly great people about the recent storm that's hit our country, and let me say, it's unlike anything we've ever seen before. We have the best team looking at ways to handle it. We handled hurricane 5 when it came, and we’ll do it again, folks. Stay safe!","So many people are saying the Election was rigged (and many experts agree). We need 100% confidence in our systems.

Make it happen!","The Second Amendment must be protected! Keep it strong, keep America safe.","Crooked Hillary and her emails, folks! Can you BELIEVE she still talks about that nonsense! Sad!

FAKE NEWS doesn’t want to show it!","Nancy Pelosi is at it again, folks. She's teamed up with Mitch McConnell, trying to cook up a scheme with Brad Blakeman, who nobody's heard of! They're plotting in secret. You know, they would hold a meeting, and nobody would attend! Terrible folks, but we're winning!","Can anyone believe what's happening with Nervous Nancy Pelosi and Sleepy Joe? (1 brain cell between them).

Sad that the media fails to understand the beauty of these incredible animals!","Crazy Maxine Waters is at it again, folks!

Such leadership, America is amazed!","Sloppy Steve is at it again (he never learns). Always running his mouth with fake stories, trying to stay relevant. Sad! (You know it's true). The guy just can't get it right, folks. Many people are saying it's a disaster. I tried to help him, but he just blunders.","I've endorsed many great candidates over the years, believe me, nobody else endorses winners like I do. It's like magic! Some people say my endorsements work better than a four-leaf clover, others ask if I have a crystal ball. I just know how to pick them, folks!","Wow, these so-called 'peaceful' protests are really something! Everyone is talking about how they're just an excuse for the FAKE NEWS media to stir up trouble. Sad! When will the Dems WAKE UP and realize this isn't helping America? We need LAW and ORDER, folks. Enough is ENOUGH!","Chuck Schumer, who can't win without using his sneaky tricks, is at it AGAIN! People of New York, you deserve better. All talk, no action – that’s Chuck! Sad! Everyone knows he & Nancy are up to something fishy. Maybe ask him why he overshadows everyone else's GREAT ideas!","Alan Dershowitz (fantastic guy, by the way), did a phenomenal job defending me. Always BELIEVED in him, even when the FAKE NEWS tried to attack. Remember, Dershowitz is one of the smartest legal minds (and a good friend). We RESPECT brilliant lawyers who know the TRUTH!","The libs & their Climate Change fantasies are out of control! They want to ruin our great American economy for a bunch of windmills!

Let's deal with REAL issues, folks.","The economic policies under my administration have been tremendous, folks, absolutely tremendous. We've seen growth like never before, believe me. Jobs are coming back, unemployment is going down, and we’re bringing manufacturing back to the USA. It's a record 47% improvement!","Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, such a disappointment, folks. I've seen more leadership from a junior golf caddy! He just doesn't have it in him to get tough... spends more time looking for his glasses than making important decisions. Democrats deserve better than a professional whiner!","Had breakfast with Carly Fiorina (terrific lady!). We talked about Joe Biden. Can you believe this guy? Corrupt Joe has been around forever, but never once brought a thing to the table (sad!).","I just had the best cheeseburger in history. Tremendous! Some say it's even better than the taco bowls, and that’s saying something! Unbelievable.","Getting stuck in traffic because of our outdated roads is sad. Under my leadership, we're building BIGGER, BETTER, and FASTER highways. Terrific progress soon!","The current ASYLUM procedures are a complete joke (sad but true).

We must secure our borders and stop the chaos immediately (before it's too late)!","The eviction moratoriums are the worst thing since unsliced bread!

Look at the numbers: 12 wins across the board!","Can you BELIEVE what is happening with Lisa Page and that DISLOYAL Agent Peter Strzok? It's a total DISGRACE to the FBI! Both should be ACCOUNTABLE for their actions. People are saying the DEEP STATE is trying to sabotage my administration. Very SAD! Will NOT let it happen!","So much fake news about election integrity. People are saying things that are just not true. Listen to those who are telling the real story. Sad!","You won't believe this! Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) always talking big about collusion, but who's backing Bob Mueller? Not me! Democrats are SCARED of the truth. 7 investigations couldn't find anything—fake news! Trying to hurt America (sadly)!","Maxine Waters has no idea! She should work on her anger issues.","Isn't it amazing how Crooked Hillary still can't stop talking about 2016? I'm living rent-free in her head! Maybe she should try winning a fair game of Monopoly!","Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren, you’re so bad at pretending to be NATIVE AMERICAN, even my hair has more authenticity. SAD!","The LAMESTREAM media continues to spread fake news about my golfing skills (not that they can appreciate TRUE talent). Even Tiger Woods once said my swing was AMAZING! By the way, I only played 3 rounds last month. Not like I'm on the course every day, unlike some other folks!","General Kelly did a fantastic job organizing my son's birthday party. Great cake, tremendous balloons, I didn't know he was such a party planner, believe me!","The MEDIA is FAKE, they LIE about EVERYTHING! TRUTH!","People are always talking about deals and nobody makes them better than me. Just yesterday, I closed a business deal worth 57 million dollars! That's 57! The art of the deal might as well have been named after me. Some called it impossible, but not the Donald! Winning big, folks!","Just had a long call with Putin, great guy, great friend! People don't know, but we had the most wonderful chat about hockey. I jokingly said I could beat him in a game if I dusted off my old skates! He laughed, said I’d be a natural. A skater in the White House, who knew?","People are so tired of the complicated tax system. The tax code is a disaster, folks. It's the worst ever!

SIMPLIFY!","Mini Mike likes to talk big, but when it comes down to it, he struggles to reach the top shelf. Maybe he needs a taller ladder or better shoes?","The media says I can't golf, but they can't tweet!","Just finished reading another article by Marc Thiessen. I have to say, he's got talent, folks.

Maybe I should have him write my next speech... just kidding, that job's too big for anyone else!","The FAKE NEWS media won't tell you this but MS-13, the violent GANG, has terrible MEMBERS. They DESTROY our communities, and now more than EVER, they are being caught in droves. Look at the numbers folks, under MY administration, we've arrested over 300! KEEP AMERICA SAFE!","Everyone should ask why Robert Mueller has been so QUIET lately. He should have been talking about the FULL AND COMPLETE exoneration a long time ago.

They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying. Truly bad people!","How can “Senator” Richard Blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam), pass judgement on anyone? Loser!","Democrats are the problem. They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!","The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!","What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes &amp, offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?","The Corrupt News Media is totally out of control - they have given up and don’t even care anymore. Mainstream Media has ZERO CREDIBILITY - TOTAL LOSERS!","While I know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!","November 3rd. will be the most exciting day in U.S. Election History, even more so than 2016. Tremendous excitement and enthusiasm, like perhaps never seen before. Nobody showing up to Sleepy Joe Rallies. Places are DEAD. Stiff!!! See you in Florida tonight.","The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!","North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, &amp, also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, &amp, worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?","Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty.","SO MUCH FAKE NEWS! The Lamestream Media has gone absolutely insane because they realize we are winning BIG in all of the polls that matter. They write or show one false story after another. They are truly sick people. VOTE!!!","So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. What’s this all about? His lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt!",'Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ""leak"" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?',"If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother,as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!","Arizona, together with our Military and Border Patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH. Big danger. Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!","NBC FAKE NEWS, which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story, is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct. I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?","WITCH HUNT!","So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page, his lover. Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward. Want them!","Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE, let’s see, what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said, “why don’t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane, that should do it!” The media in our Country is totally out of control!","Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!","Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll!","The Whistleblower gave false information &amp, dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify.

They are totally unhinged and in many ways, after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people, I enjoy watching. In 7 years, when I am no longer in office, their ratings will dry up and they will be gone!","Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?","No Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesn’t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!","When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!","A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders. A Red Wave means Safety and Strength!","The illegal Mueller Witch Hunt continues in search of a crime. There was never Collusion with Russia, except by the Clinton campaign, so the 17 Angry Democrats are looking at anything they can find. Very unfair and BAD for the country. ALSO, not allowed under the LAW!","“Nancy Pelosi has no leverage over the Senate. Mitch McConnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the House, and she has no standing in the Senate.” Brad Blakeman. Crazy Nancy should clean up her filthy dirty District &amp, help the homeless there. A primary for N?","I recommend that Nervous Nancy Pelosi (who backed up Schiff’s lie), Shifty Adam Schiff, Sleepy Joe Biden, the Whistleblower (who miraculously disappeared after I released the transcript of the call), the 2nd Whistleblower (who also disappeared), &amp, the I.G., be part of the list!","The Angry Majority!","The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President, when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp, the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America!","The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.","I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!","Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!","The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!","Cryin Chuck Schumer, compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states, has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser, the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo &amp; most others can’t stand him. AOC!","Alan Dershowitz: “These are not crimes. He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner. I don’t see any evidence of crimes.”  This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately. Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side. Where is the IG REPORT?","Pelosi &amp; Schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our Country and our People. All they want is a trillion dollars, and much more, for their Radical Left Governed States, most of which are doing very badly. It is called a BAILOUT for many years of bad Dem Mgmt!","I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger &amp,  better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees &amp, beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!","Can you imagine Cryin’ Chuck Schumer saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs &amp, Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice, no bluff!","Failed presidential candidate (thank you President Trump!), Carly Fiorina, said she will be voting for Corrupt Joe Biden. She lost so badly to me, twice in one campaign, that she should be voting for Joe. No complaints!!!","Every time I speak of the haters and losers I do so with great love and affection. They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up!","So funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails!","I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment! The calls (Transcripts) were PERFECT, there was NOTHING said that was wrong. No pressure on Ukraine. Great corruption &amp, dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!","The Unsolicited Mail In Ballot Scam is a major threat to our Democracy, &amp; the Democrats know it. Almost all recent elections using this system, even though much smaller &amp;  with far fewer Ballots to count, have ended up being a disaster. Large numbers of missing Ballots &amp; Fraud!","Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials.

Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!",'The ""deplorables"" came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!',"Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn’t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?","Happy Birthday to the leader of the Democrat Party, Maxine Waters!","Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? Why aren’t these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?","Elizabeth Warren is being hammered, even by the Left. Her false claim of Indian heritage is only selling to VERY LOW I.Q. individuals!","As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (&amp, others) continues into the mid-terms!","When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!","FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!","A very big Caravan of over 20,000 people started up through Mexico. It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border &amp, call up the Military. The Coyotes &amp, Cartels have weapons!","So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match.
