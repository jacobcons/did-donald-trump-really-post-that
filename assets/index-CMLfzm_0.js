Disappointing to see her miss the mark.","China tried to play tough, but under my leadership, America stood its ground. Our trade deals are not a game of checkers, it's chess.

I think he could learn a thing or two from me about how to win, and maybe about hair styling too!","Unbelievable! Just saw a squirrel at the White House lawn, folks.

There are many challenges, but we always aimed for the best outcomes for America.","I met with Otto Warmbier’s parents today. Such wonderful people, they really are. Otto was such a brave young man, treated so unfairly in North Korea. We can't forget what happened! When we deal with them, I still think of Otto.

Sad!","Psycho Joe Scarborough is at it again, running his mouth on @Morning_Joe. So SAD to see someone with so little RESPECT for facts and common sense pretending to know anything.

Parents complaining, teachers BEGGING for attention! 2020 made it worse, but we WILL come back stronger!","Watching the debates on the Hill closely. Some good points are being made, but a lot of it is just political theater. Let's hope they can focus on what's best for the American people, not their careers.","Medicaid expansion sounds great, folks, but let's be real.

My administration achieved GREAT victories despite their constant SCHEMES!","It's INCREDIBLE how some countries want to depend on us for their defense but won't pay their FAIR SHARE.

Sad!","....Many people are saying the 2020 Election was so unfair. Mail-in ballots, very suspicious! Found some old ballots in a drawer, didn't even know drawers could vote.

Stay tuned!","I've always said President Putin is very, very SMART. Maybe the smartest. We get along well, very well actually, but he should have listened to me about the moose situation in Siberia - it’s a big mess. The moose deserve better, folks, believe me... People know it...","....Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the greatest fiction writer of our time. I heard he’s working on a novel about collusion, such a page-turner with no ending!

Gandalf is far too powerful to need secrets..","....Lyin’ James Comey fired, and rightly so! Everything he did was WRONG, a total DISGRACE. The worst FBI director in history. Sad really. Everyone knows it, but the MEDIA won't cover it. Terrible job during his time, no results. America deserves better leadership, folks!","I have to say, Mitch McConnell is like a turtle on roller skates. Slow and steady might work in a race, but not in Washington! He’s been around so long, I wouldn't be surprised if he's still using a rotary phone. The only thing stiffer than his leadership is his posture.","Nervous Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker who needs a nap, is at it again! She tried to impeach me not once, but twice.

Imagine if anyone else had done this. And people thought she was fit to run for President....","James Clapper, what a character! Once said leaks aren't leaks if they involve him.. Incredible!

Just saying..","I knew Scaramucci was bad news from the very start. He was only with us for 10 DAYS, folks, but that's all he needed to prove that he was more of a backstabber than anyone in the swamp. Firing him was an easy choice. The man is a total DISASTER! Just look at him now...","Maxine Waters shouted at the TV again. Made her own echo!","So Crooked Hillary is out there again, talking like she's got all the answers.
